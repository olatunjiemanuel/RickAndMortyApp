# RickAndMortyApp
Working with the Rick and Morty API to gain more knowledge on making API calls and using the data gotten in a react native application
Below you can see the working state of the App so far:

* To make the UI of this App a bit interesting, i returned a touchable profile card which contains just enough details about a character from the API, this has an onPress which triggers a modal open to display more information about each character. I also added a feature which changes color according to the status gotten from the API which can either be alive(green), dead(red), unknown (yellow).
* I have also implemented pagination by creating buttons which control a placeholder for the page number in the API URL.
* I have also added a feature to disable the previous button if the user is on page 1 of the application.
* To improve user experience, i have implemented the use of Activity Indicator to be displayed when data from the API is being fetched.
